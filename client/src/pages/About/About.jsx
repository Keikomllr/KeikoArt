            Coming and going between reality and unreality, I envisioned a dreamy world searching for what I wanted to be in my childhood. When I was a child, I was brought up surrounded by nature and animals. With coexistence of human beings and nature I once enjoyed as a core of myself, I have taken in fantasy and nature in my own way based on Japanese pop culture and comic in my work.
